# introduction to the vectorizing principle

This repo is used to illustrate the vectorization principle in a tutorial.
It is intended to be presented in a live coding session by an instructor. Autodidacts are welcome to try it out on their own, but comments may lack relevant context.

Disclaimer: The term vectorization is also used for talking about using SIMD based instruction level parallelism provided by CPUs. Here, we talk about vectorization as a library design pattern for structural data transformation code â€“ applying operations to vectors instead of scalars.
