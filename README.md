# introduction to the vectorizing principle

This repo is used to illustrate the vectorization principle in a tutorial.
It was created for an event in August 2023 and might not be kept up-to-date.

Disclaimer: The term vectorization is also used for talking about using SIMD based instruction level parallelism provided by CPUs. Here, we talk about vectorization as a library design pattern for structural data transformation code â€“ applying operations to vectors instead of scalars.
